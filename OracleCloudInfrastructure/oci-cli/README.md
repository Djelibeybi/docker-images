# Oracle Cloud Infrastructure CLI Container Image

The CLI container image is a small-footprint tool that you can use on its own or
with the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Console to complete OCI tasks. The CLI
provides the same core functionality as the Console, plus additional commands. Some of these,
such as the ability to run scripts, extend Console functionality.
